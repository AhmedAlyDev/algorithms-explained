# Algorithms Explained
A comprehensive repository for exploring algorithms from various resources.

## Description

Welcome to the **Algorithms Explained**, a centralized hub designed for learning, implementing, and mastering algorithms from various renowned resources. This repository serves as a comprehensive guide for students, educators, and professionals who seek to deepen their understanding of algorithms through practical examples and structured implementations.

## Purpose

The primary aim of this repository is to offer a well-organized collection of algorithms derived from multiple authoritative sources. By providing code examples, detailed explanations, and structured directories, we intend to make the study of algorithms accessible and engaging. Whether you are a beginner taking your first steps into the world of algorithms or an experienced developer looking to refine your skills, this repository has something for everyone.

## Features

- **Structured Learning Paths**: Algorithms are organized by source and topic, allowing for a systematic learning approach.
- **Multiple Resources**: Includes implementations from popular books like "Grokking Algorithms" and more, facilitating a diverse learning experience.
- **Comprehensive Examples**: Each algorithm is accompanied by code examples and explanations to aid understanding.
- **Scalable Design**: Easy to extend with additional algorithms, books, and topics as you progress in your learning journey.
